# Juju verify

This CLI tool is a Juju plugin that allows user to check whether it's safe
to perform some disruptive maintenance operations on Juju units, like `shutdown`
or `reboot`.

## Requirements

Juju-verify requires Juju 2.8.10 or higher.

## Supported charms

* nova-compute (Usable with the next stable release of the charm. Currently available as a [nova-compute-rc])
* ceph-osd (Usable with the custom release of the charm in rgildein namespace. [cs:~/rgildein/ceph-osd-0] and [cs:~/rgildein/ceph-mon-3])
* ceph-mon (Usable with the custom release of the charm in rgildein namespace. [cs:~/rgildein/ceph-mon-3])
* neutron-gateway (Usable with the custom release of the charm in martin-kalcok namespace. [cs:~/martin-kalcok/neutron-gateway-2])

## Supported checks

* reboot
* shutdown

**NOTE:** Final list of supported checks and what they represent is still WIP

## Contribution and lifecycle

For more information on how to contribute and the lifecycle of ``juju-verify`` tools,
visit [CONTRIBUTING] page.

## Usage example

To verify that it is safe to stop/shutdown units `nova-compute/0` and
`nova-compute/1` without affecting the rest of the OpenStack cloud environment,
run the following.

```bash
$ juju-verify shutdown --units nova-compute/0 nova-compute/1
```

**NOTE:** If you run check on multiple units at the same time, they must all run
the same charm. Trying, for example, `juju-verify shutdown --units nova-compute/1
ceph-osd/0` will result in error.

Alternatively, a machine can be targeted:

```bash
$ juju-verify shutdown --machines 0
```
